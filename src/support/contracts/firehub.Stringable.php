 * ### Stringable contract
 *
 * The Stringable interface denotes a class as having a __toString() method.
 * Unlike most interfaces, Stringable is implicitly present on any class that has the magic __toString() method
 * defined, although it can and should be declared explicitly.
 * Its primary value is to allow functions to type check against the union type string|Stringable to accept either a
 * string primitive or an object that can be cast to a string.
 * @since 1.0.0
